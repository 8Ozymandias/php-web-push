    <!-- I noticed that when I created a new page, this one, 
    to highlight just the Send push notificaiton on it's own with the other button
    removed, it wouldn't work. Most likely, I'd have to modify the code in app.js
    so it would work without the enabling push notification button being there
    but I think a quick work around is to make the button hidden and it did work
    I already use hidden input fields in rider.php and driver.php so why not use it again
